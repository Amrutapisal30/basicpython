Beginner Projects
1. Basic Data Analysis
ó	Use NumPy and Pandas to analyze a dataset (e.g., weather data, student grades, or sales data).
ó	Tasks:
o	Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, variance).
o	Identify and handle missing values.
o	Perform simple data visualization (e.g., histograms, scatter plots).
ó	Tools: Pandas for data handling, NumPy for numerical operations.

2. Movie Ratings Analysis
ó	Dataset: Use a dataset like IMDb or MovieLens.
ó	Tasks:
o	Load the data into a Pandas DataFrame.
o	Find the most popular genres.
o	Calculate the average rating for each genre.
o	Identify trends over time using a time-series column (e.g., release date).

3. Sports Statistics Dashboard
ó	Dataset: Cricket, soccer, or basketball player statistics.
ó	Tasks:
o	Calculate player performance metrics.
o	Create a leaderboard for top players.
o	Compare team performance based on historical data.
4. Stock Price Analysis
ó	Dataset: Historical stock price data (e.g., Yahoo Finance).
ó	Tasks:
o	Calculate daily returns and cumulative returns.
o	Identify the highest and lowest stock prices for a given period.
o	Visualize stock trends using line plots.

Intermediate Projects
5. Sales Data Analysis
ó	Dataset: Sales records for a company (e.g., transactions with date, region, product, and amount).
ó	Tasks:
o	Calculate total and average sales by region and product category.
o	Find the best-selling product in each region.
o	Analyze seasonality trends (e.g., sales by month or quarter).
o	Visualize sales performance using bar charts and heatmaps.
6. Customer Segmentation
ó	Dataset: E-commerce or retail customer data.
ó	Tasks:
o	Perform RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis using Pandas.
o	Cluster customers based on their buying behavior (use K-means clustering with NumPy).
o	Visualize customer segments using scatter plots.
7. Real Estate Data Analysis
ó	Dataset: Real estate property listings (e.g., location, price, size, and amenities).
ó	Tasks:
o	Find average property prices by city and type.
o	Analyze the correlation between price and size.
o	Visualize trends in property prices over time.
8. COVID-19 Data Analysis
ó	Dataset: COVID-19 case statistics (e.g., WHO or government datasets).
ó	Tasks:
o	Calculate daily and cumulative case counts.
o	Find the regions with the highest infection rates.
o	Visualize the spread of the virus using line plots and bar charts.

ó	Tasks:
o	Perform cohort analysis to understand customer retention.
o	Analyze cart abandonment rates.
o	Create a dashboard showing key performance indicators (KPIs) like conversion rate.
11. Energy Consumption Analysis
ó	Dataset: Energy usage data (e.g., electricity or gas consumption).
ó	Tasks:
o	Calculate average and peak usage by day, week, and month.
o	Identify anomalies or outliers in energy usage.
o	Predict future usage using time-series analysis.
12. Sentiment Analysis of Product Reviews
ó	Dataset: Online reviews from Amazon, Yelp, or other platforms.
ó	Tasks:

o	Analyze accident trends based on time (e.g., hour, day of the week).
o	Visualize accident hotspots using heatmaps.
14. Airline Data Analysis
ó	Dataset: Airline on-time performance (e.g., delays, cancellations).
ó	Tasks:
o	Calculate average delay time by airline and route.
o	Identify the worst-performing routes or airlines.
o	Visualize delay trends over time.
