Code Challenges
1.	Write a NumPy code to normalize an array.
python
Copy code
arr = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
normalized = (arr - arr.min()) / (arr.max() - arr.min())
print(normalized)
2.	Write a Pandas code to calculate the percentage change for a given column in a DataFrame.
python
Copy code
df['pct_change'] = df['column'].pct_change()
3.	Flatten a 2D NumPy array into a 1D array.
python
Copy code
arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
flattened = arr.flatten()
4.	Group a DataFrame by a column and calculate the mean of another column.
python
Copy code
grouped_mean = df.groupby('group_column')['value_column'].mean()
print(grouped_mean)
