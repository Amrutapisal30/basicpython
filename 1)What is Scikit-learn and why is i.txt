1)What is Scikit-learn and why is it used?

Answer: Scikit-learn is an open-source Python library that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis. It includes a wide range of algorithms for classification, regression, clustering, dimensionality reduction, and model evaluation.

2)What are the main steps involved in applying Scikit-learn for a machine learning task?

Answer:

Load data (using Pandas, NumPy, or built-in datasets in Scikit-learn).

Preprocess the data (e.g., missing values, scaling, encoding).

Split the data into training and testing sets using train_test_split().

Choose an appropriate model (e.g., RandomForestClassifier, LinearRegression).

Train the model with model.fit().

Evaluate the model using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, etc.

Tune hyperparameters with grid search or random search.

3)What is the difference between fit() and predict() in Scikit-learn?

Answer:

fit(): Trains the model on the training data.

predict(): Makes predictions on new, unseen data after the model is trained.


5)What is train_test_split() used for in Scikit-learn?

Answer: train_test_split() is used to split data into training and testing sets. It helps in assessing how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
